# TaskRemainderAndroid
This android project will help the user to have their upcoming tasks like birthday, anniversary to wish their closest one's.so that, people can't forget they closest one's important dates and their tasks.

This is a 2 page application that will help the users to see their task, appointments, meeting and stuffs. This is also a basic application that uses indent that carries information across pages in android.

In the 1st page, the program shows the list of tasks which has been already entered by user, so that the user get to remember his work at the future, if clicks the add task button, the program moves to next page so that the user is provided with the respective fields to add his/her ‘s task. Then the data is passed onto the home page, instead of indent in the 2nd page to pass the data, there is a useful function, that helps us to get the data if entered automatically. This application can come very handy when peoples tents to forget dates of their beloved ones birthday and special occasions.

I’ve implemented date and time for each task so that its even more useful of the end user. So that part was very difficult to develop, but some how I managed to finish on time.
